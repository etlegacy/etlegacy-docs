===================
List of CVARs
===================

Enemy Territory: Legacy, just like the original Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, offers a wide range of console variables, so-called *CVARs*. These are options that can be used to customize the game's behaviour, setup and appearance to accommodate the player's needs or preferences. Most can be set from the menu. But all can be set from inside a configuration file _(.cfg)_ , the command line or, in most cases from the console.

| **Description** | Used to circumvent a bug with NAT routers. The value is a random number set when  |
|                 | the client starts up.                                                             |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 - Qport was added to the NetChannel header to fix a bug. Before the qport, Quake server identified a client by the
   combination (remote IP,remote UDP port). This worked fine most of the time but certain NAT router can change their
   schema of port translation (remote UDP port) sporadically. UDP port being unreliable, John Carmack explained in one
   of his plans that he decided to identify a client by (remote IP, Qport in NetChannel header). This fixed the
   confusion and also allowed the server to adjust the target UDP response port on the fly.
