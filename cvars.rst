===================
List of CVARs
===================

Enemy Territory: Legacy, just like the original Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, offers a wide range of console variables, so-called *CVARs*. These are options that can be used to customize the game's behaviour, setup and appearance to accommodate the player's needs or preferences. Most can be set from the menu. But all can be set from inside a configuration file _(.cfg)_ , the command line or, in most cases from the console.
